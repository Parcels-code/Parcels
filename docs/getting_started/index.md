# Getting started

Getting started with parcels is easy; here you will find:

```{toctree}
The installation guide <installation.md>
<!-- - a quickstart tutorial to running your first simulation <../examples_v3/parcels_tutorial.ipynb>
- an overview of the important concepts <concepts_overview.md>
- a simple tutorial on how to analyse the output from your first simulation <../examples_v3/tutorial_output.ipynb> -->

```
```{note}
TODO: Include one line conda installation for most common use
```

```{note}
TODO: Write quickstart tutorial. This should focus on getting users familiar with the different steps to take to run a simulation. Implicitly we should introduce them to the important concepts, but it should not be an in depth explanation. Instead we should reference to the concept overview and the reference API
```

```{note}
TODO: Rewrite parcels concepts overview. This .md file should contain most of what is currently in the tutorial_parcels_structure notebook.
