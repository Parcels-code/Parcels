# Documentation Notes

## Vision

We believe a clear documentation is important to community building, reproducibility, and transparency in our open-source project. To make it easier to write our documentation in a consistent way, here we outline a brief vision for our documentation based heavily on a few common resources.

```{note}
TODO: outline functions of the documentation based on resources

### Resources

- [Divio Documentation System](https://docs.divio.com/documentation-system/)
- [PyOpenSci Documentation Guide](https://www.pyopensci.org/python-package-guide/documentation/index.html#)
- [Write the Docs Guide](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/)
- [NumPy Documentation Article](https://labs.quansight.org/blog/2020/03/documentation-as-a-way-to-build-community)

## Style guide

- Write documentation in first person plural ("we"). In our open source code, tutorials and guides can be written by any developer or user, so the documentation teaches all of us how to do something with Parcels.
