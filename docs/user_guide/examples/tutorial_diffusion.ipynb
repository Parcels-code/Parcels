    "# Diffusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In Eulerian ocean models, sub-grid scale dispersion of tracers such as heat, salt, or nutrients is often parameterized as a diffusive process. In Lagrangian particle simulations, sub-grid scale effects can be parameterized as a stochastic process, randomly displacing a particle position in proportion to the local eddy diffusivity ([Van Sebille et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2017.11.008)). Parameterizing sub-grid scale dispersion may be especially important when coarse velocity fields are used that do not resolve mesoscale eddies ([Shah et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1175/JPO-D-16-0098.1)). This tutorial explains how to use a sub-grid scale parameterization in _Parcels_ that is consistent with the advection-diffusion equation used in Eulerian models.\n",

    "The time-evolution of a stochastic process is described by a stochastic differential equation. The time-evolution of the conditional probability density of a stochastic process is described by a Fokker-Planck equation (FPE). The advection-diffusion equation, describing the evolution of a tracer, can be written as a Fokker-Planck equation. Therefore, we can formulate a stochastic differential equation for a particle in the Lagrangian frame undergoing advection with stochastic noise proportional to the local diffusivity in a way that is consistent with advection-diffusion in the Eulerian frame. For details, see [Shah et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2011.05.008) and [van Sebille et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocemod.2017.11.008).\n",

    "## Using Advection-Diffusion Kernels in Parcels\n",
    "\n",
    "The EM and M1 advection-diffusion approximations are available as `AdvectionDiffusionEM` and `AdvectionDiffusionM1`, respectively. The `AdvectionDiffusionM1` kernel should be the default choice, as the increased accuracy comes at negligible computational cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advection component of these kernels is similar to that of the Explicit Euler advection kernel (`AdvectionEE`). In the special case where diffusivity is constant over the entire domain, the diffusion-only kernel `DiffusionUniformKh` can be used in combination with an advection kernel of choice. Since the diffusivity here is space-independent, gradients are not calculated, increasing efficiency. The diffusion-step can in this case be computed after or before advection, thus allowing you to chain kernels in a list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like velocities, diffusivities are passed to Parcels in the form of `Field` objects. When using `DiffusionUniformKh`, they should be added to the `FieldSet` object as constant fields, e.g. `fieldset.add_constant_field(\"Kh_zonal\", 1, mesh=\"flat\")`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a central difference approximation for computing the gradient in diffusivity, a resolution for this approximation `dres` is needed: _Parcels_ approximates the gradients in diffusivities by using their values at the particle's location ± `dres` (in both $x$ and $y$). A value of `dres` must be specified and added to the FieldSet by the user (e.g. `fieldset.add_constant(\"dres\", 0.01)`). Currently, it is unclear what the best value of `dres` is. From experience, the size of `dres` should be smaller than the spatial resolution of the data, but within reasonable limits of machine precision to avoid numerical errors. We are working on a method to compute gradients differently so that specifying `dres` is not necessary anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example: Impermeable Diffusivity Profile\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see the `AdvectionDiffusionM1` in action and see why it's preferable over the `AdvectionDiffusionEM` kernel. To do so, we create an idealized profile with diffusivities $K_\\text{zonal}$ uniform everywhere ($K_\\text{zonal} = \\bar{K}=0.5$) and $K_\\text{meridional}$ constant in the zonal direction, while having the following profile in the meridional direction:\n",
