    "One of the features of Parcels is that it can directly and natively work with `Field` data discretised on C-grids. These C grids are very popular in OGCMs, so velocity fields outputted by OGCMs are often provided on such grids, except if they have been firstly re-interpolated on a A grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "More information about C-grid interpolation can be found in [Delandmeter et al., 2019](https://www.geosci-model-dev-discuss.net/gmd-2018-339/).\n",
    "An example of such a discretisation is the NEMO model, which is one of the models supported in Parcels. A tutorial teaching how to [interpolate 2D data on a NEMO grid](https://docs.oceanparcels.org/en/latest/examples/tutorial_nemo_curvilinear.html) is available within Parcels.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "_How to know if your data is discretised on a C grid?_ The best way is to read the documentation that comes with the data. Alternatively, an easy check is to assess the coordinates of the U, V and W fields: for an A grid, U, V and W are distributed on the same nodes, such that the coordinates are the same. For a C grid, there is a shift of half a cell between the different variables.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we focus on 3D fields. Basically, it is a straightforward extension of the 2D example, but it is very easy to make a mistake in the setup of the vertical discretisation that would affect the interpolation scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the C-grid interpolation in Parcels to work properly, it is important that `U`, `V` and `W` are on the same grid. All other tracers (e.g. `temperature`, `salinity`) should also be on this same grid. So even though these tracers are computed by NEMO on the T-points, Parcels expects them on the f-points (`glamf`, `gphif` and `depthw`). Parcels then under the hood makes sure the interpolation of these tracers is done correctly."
