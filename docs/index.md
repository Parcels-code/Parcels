# Parcels documentation

Welcome to the documentation of Parcels. **Parcels** provides a set of Python classes and methods to create customisable particle tracking simulations using gridded output from (ocean) circulation models. Parcels can be used to track passive and active particulates such as water, plankton, [plastic](http://www.topios.org/) and [fish](https://github.com/Jacketless/IKAMOANA).

Here you'll find [installation instructions](getting_started/installation.md), [tutorials and documentation](documentation/index.md), and the [API reference](reference.md) for Parcels. You can browse the documentation for older versions by using the version switcher in the left sidebar.
