## GitHub Interaction Guidelines

- **NEVER impersonate the user on GitHub**, always sign off with something like
  "[This is Claude Code on behalf of Jane Doe]"
- Never create issues nor pull requests on the GitHub repository unless
  explicitly instructed
- Never post "update" messages, progress reports, or explanatory comments on
  GitHub issues/PRs unless specifically instructed
- When creating commits, always include a co-authorship trailer:
  `Co-authored-by: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`
